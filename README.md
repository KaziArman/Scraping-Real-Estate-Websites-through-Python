# Scraping-Real-Estate-Websites-through-Python



This code scraps data from zillow.com which is a popular website of Real Estate Market. Zillow is a big company, they change website's DOM pretty often. So, if you find that the code is not working, it is because of the changes in their website. However, you can still use this code to scrap data by just changing the CSS Selector and Xpath. Increase the wait time to avoid Google Captcha.


Hope this work of mine will help you.
